Hello, this is my work for IE4214/ISYE4803 Revenue Management at National University of Singapore, Spring 2023.

- Project Description.pdf - Assignment from the professor.
- Report.pdf - Summary of our work process and final solutions.
- Discrete Choice Models.pdf - My textbook-style derivation of models used.

If you would like to see an example of my code writing, see ___loglikelihood.py___ and its demonstrations in ___new_approach.ipynb___.

Biogeme is an open-source Python library.
In one attempt at improvement I modified the source code,
but this was not included in my final solutions, biogeme_nice.py (using the original library) and loglikelihood.py (without biogeme).
